# Simple Harmonic Motion Simulation, in Swift.
A little app to help you understand [simple harmonic motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion).

## Feature List
- Add/remove bodies on screen, suspended by two connecting springs 
- Displace bodies with your finger and watch them in motion
- Adjust mass, damping and appearance of bodies **[in development]**
- Adjust stiffness (spring constant) and appearance of springs **[in development]**
- Toggle 'motion trails' that travel up the screen for bodies **[in development]**
- Record and export simulation data as file **[in development]**
- Some useful information about the actual physics **[in development]**
